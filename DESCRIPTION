Description: Functions using Cohen's effect sizes (Cohen, Jacob. Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences. Academic press, 2013) are provided for reliable feature selection in biology data analysis.  In addition to Cohen's effect sizes, p-values are calculated and adjusted from quasi-Poisson GLM, negative binomial GLM and Normal distribution ANOVA.  Significant features (genes, RNAs or proteins) are selected by adjusted p-value and minimum Cohen's effect sizes, calculated to keep certain level of statistical power of biology data analysis given p-value threshold and sample size.
